# Design-5

## Problem 1: 
This problem was asked at Intuit

Design a parking lot system where you need to provide a token with the parking space number on it to each new entry for the space closest to the entrance. 
When someone leave you need update this space as empty. 
What data structures will you use to perform the closest empty space tracking, plus finding what all spaces are occupied at a give time.
